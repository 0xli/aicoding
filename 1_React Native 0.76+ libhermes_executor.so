Some problem is small but you still not fix it after spending many time on #cursor or #chatgpt, it turned out to be a
#AI_not_solved_programming_problem, like this, when I upgrade my React Native version from 0.73.0 to 0.79.2, my native App written in java :
java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: dlopen failed: library "libhermes_executor.so" not found at 

but if you not reply on AI and get help from old friends from google, you can solve it within 30 minutes:

https://reactnative.dev/blog/2024/10/23/release-0.76-new-architecture#android-apps-are-38mb-smaller-thanks-to-native-library-merging

this fix is this:
+import com.facebook.react.soloader.OpenSourceMergedSoMapping
import com.facebook.soloader.SoLoader

class MainApplication : Application(), ReactApplication {

  override fun onCreate() {
    super.onCreate()
+   SoLoader.init(this, OpenSourceMergedSoMapping)
-   SoLoader.init(this, false)
  }
}
